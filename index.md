## About Me
Thank you for visiting my website! I am a data scientist and independent consultant. I help companies find value in their data and use machine learning and analytics to solve business problems. I have extensive experience solving a broad range of machine learning problems (e.g., time series forecasting, natural language processing, computer vision) and I have experience applying machine learning at companies as large as 50,000+ employees to as small as 10 employees. Here are some questions I have recently helped solve:

- How can I find value in all of this text data I have?
- Can I forecast my sales?
- Is there a way I can detect anomalies in my data?
- How can I prioritize resource spending?
- Is there a way I can automatically classify these images into different categories?
- Can you create a Python library to solve problem X?
- Where in my company is the largest potential for machine learning applications?

If you think I may able to help you, let's chat! I can be reached at zachmonge[at]gmail.com.
